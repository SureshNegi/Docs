Grid:
The Bootstrap grid behaves like a table. There are rows and columns. However, unlike tables, Bootstrap uses CSS to manage the layout of the pages. In addition, Bootstrap offers support for mobile browsers and different sized screens
by providing different grids for different screen sizes. 
There are four screensizes provided by Bootstrap grids. This allows developers to size content appropriately for various devices.

Grid notes:
Always 12 columns
Smaller sizes set the default for larger sizes
col-sm- would set the size for small, medium and large screens unless overridden by a setting specific to one of the larger sizes
There is a 30px "gutter", or empty space, between each column (15px on each side of the column)
The gutter on the outside of the container varies based on the current screen size
Extra small devices always use the entire width of the screen
