It suffers from the closure loop problem. I strongly recommend that you spend some time on this. Understanding scope is vital to successful JavaScript programming. Consider this example:
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    console.log('in for: ' + i);
    setTimeout(function() {
        console.log('in func: ' + i);
    }, 0);
}
console.log('for complete');
in for: 0
in for: 1
in for: 2
for complete
in func: 3
in func: 3
in func: 3
