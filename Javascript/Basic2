DOM?
When a user clicks on a link or enters a URL in the address of your Web browser, it downloads the page’s HTML text and builds up a model of the document’s structure called the DOM (Document Object Model). This model is used to render the HTML page on the screen
The DOM is a standard  that describes how a document must be manipulated. It defines a “language- and platform neutral interface”. So, every browser offers the same JavaScript DOM API.

The DOM API is a programming interface the JavaScript programmer can use to modify the HTML content or the CSS style of HTML elements on the fly.

Accessing DOM?
In JavaScript, the DOM is accessible through the property document of the global object window. We rarely manipulate the window object directly as it is implicit: window.document is the same as document. 

So by using this object, we can access and manipulate our page from JavaScript as a structured document.

Types of nodes in the DOM?
There are different types of nodes, but don't worry - the most useful ones are highlighted in bold.
•Element (example: <ul></ul>)
•Text (example: <p>the text within the element p is a node of type text</p>)
•Document, DocumentFragment, DocumentType (example: <!doctype html> for html5), Comment (example: <!-- left column -->), ProcessingInstruction (example: <?php echo $name ?>)
