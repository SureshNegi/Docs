What is i18n?
'Internationalization' is sometimes abbreviated to 'i18n' in English, because there are 18 characters between the 'i' and the 'n'.
Access to the Web for all has been a fundamental concern and goal of the W3C since the beginning. It is easy to overlook the needs of people from cultures different to your own, or who use different languages or writing systems, but you have to ensure that any content or application that you design or develop is ready to support the international features that they will need.

Why?
If you don't use those features you will create barriers for people from different cultures who are trying to access your content. This is important even if you think you are only designing for a specific community â€“ communities are made up of diverse individuals, and the Web stretches worldwide.

Which Encoding?
https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-choosing-encodings
As a content author or developer, you should nowadays always choose the UTF-8 character encoding for your content or data. This Unicode encoding is a good choice because you can use a single encoding to handle any character you are likely to meet. This greatly simplifies things.

Essential steps in Web internationalization?
1)Example of char encoding:
Check #1: There is a character encoding declaration near the start of your source code, and  its value is UTF-8.
    <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8"/>
    ...
    </head>

Check #2: The HTML tag has a lang attribute which correctly indicates the language of your content.
example 2: This indicates that the page is in French.
    <!doctype html>
    <html lang="fr">
    <head>

Q)void elements?
These elements, without a "/" at the end, are called "void elements". They are : area, base, br, col, embed, hr, img, input, link, menuitem, meta, param, source, track, wbr.

Q)what is EcmaScript?
Towards the end of 1996, JavaScript was standardized by ECMA as the EcmaScript standard. So no matter whether you see it called JavaScript or EcmaScript, don't worry, it's the same thing.

Q)ES2015 or ES6?
the latest official version is version 6, also called ES2015 or ES6. A 7th version is on its way (called ES2016, ES2016+, ES7, JavaScript 7...).

Q)Why Javascript?
In the beginning, JavaScript was invented to work not only on the client side (in Web browsers) but also on 
the server side (on the Netscape HTTP Web server back in 1995).

In recent years this trend has returned, thanks to the appearance of the Node.js server/JavaScript interpreter. 
It's common to see JavaScript applications running on a remote Web server. This particular use of JavaScript will be 
covered by another course that will be proposed by W3Cx, but mastering JavaScript basics is highly recommended before trying to learn JavaScript server side programming.

Q)JavaScript is an interpreted language?
JavaScript is an interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) language, which means that the code is converted into a machine language at, or just before, runtime. The most popular JavaScript engines are:

        SpiderMonkey (included in Mozilla Firefox)
        JavaScriptCore (included in Apple Safari)
        Chrome V8 (included in Google Chrome, in the Node.js server)
        Chakra (included in Microsoft Internet Explorer and now in the Microsoft Edge browser)
        
 Q)What is DOM API?
 In the case of JavaScript, the DOM API is implemented natively by the browser, and you can call several functions/methods or access properties of the DOM:  an object that represents the document (the Web page). 

Q)selector API ?
It uses the selector API to target a particular part of the DOM (in our case, the main title of the page), the HTML element with an id attribute equal to "mainTitle". The selector API uses the same syntax as CSS to select elements in the document. In our case, "#mainTitle" is a selector value that means "the element whose id is equal to mainTitle".

Q)Other API?
use numerous APIs in addition to the DOM and selector APIs: multimedia, drawing, animating, geolocation, webcam, etc.
You will have APIs for manipulating multimedia (audio and video), geolocation (getting the longitude and latitude), orientation (on mobile devices), accessing the webcam or the microphone, etc.
E.g google map API

Q)type="text/javascript"?
Old JavaScript examples may use a type attribute:
<script type="text/javascript">.
The type attribute is now obsolete and should be ignored.
