In a hash table, data is stored in an array format, where each data value has its own unique index value. 
Access of data becomes very fast if we know the index of the desired data.
Hashing is a technique to convert a range of key values into a range of indexes of an array. We're going to use modulo operator to get a range of key values. Consider an example of hash table of size 20, 
and the following items are to be stored. Item are in the (key,value) format.
