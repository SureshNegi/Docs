Data Definition?
Data Definition defines a particular data with the following characteristics.
Atomic − Definition should define a single concept.
Traceable − Definition should be able to be mapped to some data element.
Accurate − Definition should be unambiguous.
Clear and Concise − Definition should be understandable.

Data Object
Data Object represents an object having a data.

Data Type?
ata type is a way to classify various types of data such as integer, string, etc. which determines the values that can be used with the corresponding type of data, 
the type of operations that can be performed on the corresponding type of data. 

Built-in Data Type?
Those data types for which a language has built-in support are known as Built-in Data types. For example,
most of the languages provide the following built-in data types.
Integers
Boolean (true, false)
Floating (Decimal numbers)
Character and Strings

Derived Data Type?
Those data types which are implementation independent as they can be implemented in one or the other way are known as derived data types.
These data types are normally built by the combination of primary or built-in data types and associated operations on them
Example:
List,Array,Stack,Queue etc

Basic Operations on data structure?
Traversing,Searching,Insertion,Deletion,Sorting,Merging

Array?
Array is a container which can hold a fix number of items and these items should be of the same type.
