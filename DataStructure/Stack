A stack is an Abstract Data Type (ADT), commonly used in most programming languages. It is named stack as it behaves like a real-world stack, 
for example – a deck of cards or a pile of plates, etc.

Operations:
push() − Pushing (storing) an element on the stack.
pop() − Removing (accessing) an element from the stack.
peek() − get the top data element of the stack, without removing it.
isFull() − check if stack is full.
isEmpty() − check if stack is empty.

Implementation?
Can be implemented by array or list

Programming Question:
write a programme to solve the postfix expression(e.g 123+*) using stack?
