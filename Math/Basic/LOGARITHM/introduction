A logarithm is the power to which a number must be raised in order to get some other number (see Section 3 of this Math Review for more about exponents). For example, the base ten logarithm of 100 is 2, because ten raised to the power of two is 100:
log 100 = 2
because
102 = 100

default base is 10:
log a = r

a natural logarithmic equation is usually written in the form:
ln a = r
