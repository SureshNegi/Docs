Q)What is CSS?
*CSS is a language that describes the style of an HTML document:Cascading Style Sheets
*CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
*CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
*Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.
To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.

Q)CSS Syntax
selector {declaration1;declaration2} e.g h1{color:red}

Q)CSS Selectors
CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) HTML elements based on their element name, id, class, attribute, and more.

Q)Grouping Selectors?
If you have elements with the same style definitions, like this:
h1 {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
}

h2 {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
}

p {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
}

It will be better to group the selectors, to minimize the code as below:
h1, h2, p {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
}

Q)Ways to insert css?
External Style Sheet,Internal Style Sheet,Inline Style Sheet

Q)background-image css property?
*By default, the background-image property repeats an image both horizontally and vertically 
body {
    background-image: url("gradient_bg.png");
}

*To repeat only horizontally: background-repeat:(similarily repeat-y)
body {
    background-image: url("gradient_bg.png");
    background-repeat: repeat-x;
}

*If no need to repeat:
body {
    background-image: url("img_tree.png");
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
}

Q)Why repeat
* image may be very small size.By repeating it look like big image coverinng complete required element

Q)Background - Shorthand property
* To shorten the code, it is also possible to specify all the background properties in one single property.(color,image,position etc in one property)
body {
    background: #ffffff url("img_tree.png") no-repeat right top;
}

Q)When using the shorthand property the order of the property values?
*  background-color,background-image,background-repeat,background-attachment,background-position
* It does not matter if one of the property values is missing, as long as the other ones are in this order.

Q) CSS Borders?
* Allow you to specify the style, width, and color of an element's border.
* Border - Individual Sides 
p {
    border-top-style: dotted;
    border-right-style: solid;
    border-bottom-style: dotted;
    border-left-style: solid;
}
*border-style covers all border(top right bottom left)

Q)Border - Shorthand Property
p {
    border: 5px solid red;
}
sequence:border-width,border-style (required),border-color

Q)CSS Box Model?
*From CSS box model point of view, CSS box means  a box that wraps around every HTML element.
*Different layers or parts of this box:
    Content - The content of the box(say span, div etc), where text and images appear
    Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
    Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
    Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

Q) Why box model is important?
* In order to set the width and height of an element correctly in all browsers, you need to know how the box model works.
* When you set the width and height properties of an element with CSS, you just set the width and height of the content area.
 To calculate the full size of an element, you must also add padding, borders and margins.

suppose we want to style a <div> element to have a total width of 350px:

	div {
		width: 320px; //just width of the content of the element
		padding: 10px;
		border: 5px solid gray;
		margin: 0;
	}
	Here is the Math for calculate full with :
	...............................
	320px (width)
	+ 20px (left + right padding)
	+ 10px (left + right border)
	+ 0px (left + right margin)
	= 350px 

Q) CSS Outline VS Border
An outline is a line that is drawn around elements (outside the borders) to make the element "stand out".(border outside border)

Q)text-decoration?
* Used to set or remove decorations from text
* text-decoration: none; is often used to remove underlines from links:
	h1 {
		text-decoration: overline;
	}

	h2 {
		text-decoration: line-through;
	}

	h3 {
		text-decoration: underline;
	}

Q) Text Transformation
* It can be used to turn everything into uppercase or lowercase letters, or capitalize the first letter of each word:
  
	p.uppercase {
		text-transform: uppercase;
	}

	p.lowercase {
		text-transform: lowercase;
	}

	p.capitalize {
		text-transform: capitalize;
	}
	
Q) text-indent
* is used to specify the indentation of the first line of a text(text-indent: 50px;)

Q) letter-spacing(letter-spacing: 3px;).Similarly word-spacing: 10px;

Q) Line Height
* ine-height property is used to specify the space between lines( line-height: 1.8)

Q)CSS FONTS
* The CSS font properties define the font family, boldness, size, and the style of a text.
*font-family:property should hold several font names as a "fallback" system.If the browser does not support the first font, it tries the next font, and so on.
  font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
* font-style(normal,italic etc) : font-style: normal;
* font-size :The font-size property sets the size of the text.
 *font-weight property specifies the weight of a font: font-weight: normal; font-weight: bold;
 
Q)Set Font Size With Pixels?
* Setting the text size with pixels gives you full control over the text size:
	h1 {
		font-size: 40px;
	}

	h2 {
		font-size: 30px;
	}

	p {
		font-size: 14px;
	}
Q)Set Font Size With Em?
* The em size unit is recommended by the W3C.
* 1em is equal to the current font size. The default text size in browsers is 16px. So, the default size of 1em is 16px.(pixels/16=em)
	h1 {
		font-size: 2.5em; /* 40px/16=2.5em */
	}
Q) Use a Combination of Percent and Em
* The solution that works in all browsers, is to set a default font-size in percent for the <body> element:	
	body {
		font-size: 100%;
	}

	h1 {
		font-size: 2.5em;
	}
	
Q) What is Font Awesome?
* It is an icon library.We can add an icon to your HTML element/page by using the library.(reusability of icons)
* <i class="fa fa-cloud"></i>(considering icon library css is added) fa means font awsome

Q)Bootstrap Icons
* If we are using bootstrap in our project then we can use the icons provided free of cost
* <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-cloud"></i>

Q) Google Icons
* add this in head <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons">
* <i class="material-icons">cloud</i>

Q)CSS position?
* There are four different position values:static,relative,fixed,absolute
* Heigth, width,margin etc may work  differently depending on the position value.

Q) Static position?
* Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
* An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page
* It can not be positioned using left,right,top etc.Always rendered as normal flow of page
https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_position_static

Q)position: relative;(moves with scroll)

Q)position: fixed;(not moves with scroll)	
It always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.

Q)position: absolute;(moves with scroll)
https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_position_absolute
* An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor 
(instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).
* However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling
* A "positioned" element is one whose position is anything except static

Q) Example describing z-index and absolute?

Q)CSS Combinators?
* A combinator is something that explains the relationship between the selectors.
https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_combinators.asp
* Descendant Selector:div p
* Child Selector : div > p(the immediate children of a specified element.)
* Adjacent Sibling Selector : div + p(The following example selects all <p> elements that are placed immediately after <div> elements)

Q) CSS Pseudo-classes
* A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.
* For example, it can be used to:
	Style an element when a user mouses over it
    Style visited and unvisited links differently
    Style an element when it gets focus
* The syntax of pseudo-classes:selector:pseudo-class {  property:value;}
* Example:
	/* unvisited link */
	a:link {
		color: #FF0000;
	}

	/* visited link */
	a:visited {
		color: #00FF00;
	}

	/* mouse over link */
	a:hover {
		color: #FF00FF;
	}

	/* selected link */
	a:active {
		color: #0000FF;
	} 

Q) An example of using the :hover pseudo-class on a <div> element?
div:hover {
    background-color: blue;
}

Q)Opacity?
* specifies the opacity/transparency of an element
* https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_image_opacity

Q) CSS attribute selectors?
* The attribute selectors can be useful for styling forms without class or ID:
	input[type="text"] {
		width: 150px;
		display: block;
		margin-bottom: 10px;
		background-color: yellow;
	}

	input[type="button"] {
		width: 120px;
		margin-left: 35px;
		display: block;
	}
