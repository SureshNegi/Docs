Q) Setting The Viewport?<meta>?
* HTML5 introduced a method to let web designers take control over the viewport, through the <meta> tags:
* We should include the following <meta> viewport element in all our web pages, if we are using HTML5
* <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).
