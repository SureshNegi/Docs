Q) What is Angularjs?
* a client side  framework for dynamic web apps
* We use HTML as template language and can extend HTML's syntax to express application's components clearly   and    succinctly(in short).

Q) Advantages?
* AngularJS's data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code you would otherwise have to write.

Q) Why framework is used?
* The impedance mismatch(obstacles) between dynamic applications and static documents is often solved with:
  A library - a collection of functions which are useful when writing web apps. Your code is in charge and it calls 	      into the library when it sees fit. E.g., jQuery.
  Frameworks - a particular implementation of a web application, where your code fills in the details. The 		framework is in charge and it calls into your code when it needs something app specific. E.g., 				durandal, ember, etc.

Q) AngularJs concepts?
* Everything you need to must know: Data-binding, basic templating directives, form validation, routing, deep-  linking, reusable components and dependency injection.
* Testability story: Unit-testing, end-to-end testing, mocks and test harnesses.

Q) Idea Of angularjs?
* idea to decouple DOM manipulation from app logic(directives),dramatically improves testability of the code.
* an excellent idea to decouple the client side of an app(javascript+html+css) from the server side(API).This     allows development work to progress in parallel, and allows for reuse of both sides(MyTime UI+Oracle API).
* A good Framework should  guide developers through the entire journey of building an app:From designing the UI,   through   writing the business logic, to testing

Q) What is the Factory Vs service?
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23074875/angularjs-factory-and-service
* service internally use factory.

Q) You can set up a service in the exact same way as you can set up a factory (IE have it return an object) and the service behaves the exact same    as a factory.Why to use factory over service?

Q) why factory service Cannot be injected in .config() function. 

Q) When should I use them factory or service?
*  Factory is mostly preferable in all cases. It can be used when you have constructor function which needs to be instantiated in different controllers.
*  Service is a kind of Singleton Object. The Object return from Service will be same for all controller. It can be used when you want to have single object    for entire application. Eg: Authenticated user details.

Q)The return result from Factory and Service will be cache and same will be returned for all controllers?
