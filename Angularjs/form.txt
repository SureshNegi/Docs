Q) FormController?  

Q) ngModelOptions directive?
* By default, any change to the content will trigger a model update and form validation. You can override this behavior using the ngModelOptions 
  directive to bind only to specified list of events. I.e. ng-model-options="{ updateOn: 'blur' }" will update and validate only after the control loses focus. You can set several events using a space delimited list. I.e. ng-model-options="{ updateOn: 'mousedown blur' }"
* Non-immediate (debounced) model updates: ng-model-options="{ debounce: 500 }"
