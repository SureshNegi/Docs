factory:
factory takes the function object and create the corresponding provide for that factory
when any controller inject factory by asking injector,injector call the corresponding provide

service:
in service we write the constructor function
when we creat the service like angular.service('name',constructorfun);
angular service create the object by this constructorfun(object.create()...)
internally service call factory
