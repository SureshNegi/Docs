$destroy event?
There are a few special events that AngularJS emits. When a DOM node that has been compiled with AngularJS's compiler is destroyed, it emits a $destroy event. Similarly, when an AngularJS scope is destroyed, 
it broadcasts a $destroy event to listening scopes.
By listening to this event, you can remove event listeners that might cause memory leaks. Listeners registered to scopes and elements are automatically cleaned up when they are destroyed, but if you registered a listener on a service, or registered a listener on a DOM node that isn't being deleted, 
you'll have to clean it up yourself or you risk introducing a memory leak.
