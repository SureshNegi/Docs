Abstraction and encapsulation are complementary concepts: abstraction focuses on the observable behavior of an object... 
encapsulation focuses upon the implementation that gives rise to this behavior... encapsulation is most often achieved through 
information hiding, which is the process of hiding all of the secrets of object that do not contribute to its essential characteristics
 -- we create class - encaptulation
 -- we create class, use defferent public private methods in classes and use different access modefiers -- process of acieving abstraction
 
 In other words: abstraction = the object externally; encapsulation (achieved through information hiding) = the object internally,
