Imagin you are god and creating universe blue print(class) before creating the actual entity(object):
*BluePrint/Class(Base class): You design Bluprint for human beings(class for human beings) named this HumanBeings
Defines properties and its functions. Like  having body parts, and performing various actions.

*Inheritence:As a god I want to create 2 types of human beings male and femal
Therefore I design 2 more blue print:
One blue print(class) for Male Named Male
One blue print(class) for Female Named Female
Now we have 3 blue prints(class) HumanBeings,Male and female
But as a designer I know Male and female both belongs to HumanBeings(subset of human beings).This is the concept of inheritence
"when A class is subset of oher class B It means A is inheriting B"
