Imagin you are god and creating universe blue print(class) before creating the actual entity(object):
*BluePrint/Class(Base class): You design Bluprint for human beings(class for human beings) named this HumanBeings
Defines properties and its functions. Like  having body parts, and performing various actions.

*Inheritence:As a god I want to create 2 types of human beings male and femal
Therefore I design 2 more blue print:
One blue print(class) for Male Named Male(copy of blue print of HumanBeings and with some unique properties/functions)
One blue print(class) for Female Named Female(copy of blue print of HumanBeings and with some unique properties/functions)
Now we have 3 blue prints(class) HumanBeings,Male and female
But as a designer I know Male and female both belongs to HumanBeings(subset of human beings).This is the concept of inheritence
"when A class is subset of oher class B It means A is inheriting B" 
Now I can design more blue prints(class) which may have the copy of Humanbeings + other specific- reusability of design(class)

*Objects:Now I(god) want to create phisical entity Of  male and  Female.These phisical entities are objects which takes the actual space
On this earth(memory), perform actions etc(define in blueprint- class).

*Abstraction:
*Encapsulation
*Polymorphism
