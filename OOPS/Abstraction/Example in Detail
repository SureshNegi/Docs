Objects in an OOP language provide an abstraction that hides the internal implementation details. Similar to the coffee machine
in your kitchen, you just need to know which methods of the object are available to call and which input parameters are needed to trigger a specific operation. But you donâ€™t need to understand how this method is implemented 
and which kinds of actions it has to perform to create the expected result.
