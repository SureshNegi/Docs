Generics provide the solution to a limitation in earlier versions of the common language runtime and the C# language 
in which generalization is accomplished by casting types to and from the universal base type Object.

By creating a generic class, you can create a collection that is type-safe at compile-time.
Example:
User Case you want to create a integer type list:
 List<int> a = new List<int>();
            a.Add(1); //error on compile time if add other type of value

ArrayList b = new ArrayList();
b.Add("1"); // no error on compile time //you have to take care of casting if required
