Before .NET 4.0, the following code causes compilation error, but now you can use strings instead of objects, as shown in the example, 
because the IEnumerable(Of T) interface is covariant.

IEnumerable<String> strings = new List<String>();
IEnumerable<Object> objects = strings;
But below code will give error(item can be added in list, show in int type list other type can be added 
if compiler allow this to pass in any other function accepting IEnumerable(Of T))
List<int> a = new List<int>();            
objects = a;
