Covariance and Contravariance are polymorphism extension to the arrays, delegates and generics. It provides implicit reference conversion for Arrays, Delegates and Generic parameter types. 
Covariance preserves the assignment compatibility and Contravariance opposite the covariance functionality.

Assignment Compatibility :
  String stringObject = "A String Object";
  Object anObject = stringObject;

An Object of a derived class (stringObject) is being assigned to a variable of a base class (anObject).

Array Covariance:
object[] objArray = new String[10];

Array Covariance is not safe. 
objArray[0] = 5;
That statement will not report any compile time errors. But at runtime, it causes an ArrayTypeMismatchException exception. 
It is due to the fact that the objArray variable actually holds a reference of a string Array.

Delegate Covariance:
