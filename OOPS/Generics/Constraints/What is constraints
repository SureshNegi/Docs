Constraints inform the compiler about the capabilities a type argument must have.
Without any constraints, the type argument could be any type.
If client code tries to instantiate your class by using a type that is not allowed by a constraint, the result is a compile-time error. 
Constraints are specified by using the where contextual keyword.
