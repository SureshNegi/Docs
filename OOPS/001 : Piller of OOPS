1)Encapsulation
2)Abstraction
3)Inheritance
4)Polymorphism

1)Encapsulation:
In oops we create class that is(encapsulate data memeber and methods in one unit.) that is called Encapsulation
Encapsulation is all about binding the data variables and functions together in class

Abstraction: Abstraction refers to showing only the essential features of the application and hiding the details. 
In C++/Java, classes provide methods to the outside world to access & use the data variables, but the variables are hidden 
from direct access. This can be done access specifiers.
For example: phone call, we don't know the internal processing
Abstraction = Encapsulation + Data Hiding

Inheritance: Inheritance is a way to reuse code. The class which is inherited from,
is called the base class, and the class which inherits the code from the base class is called a derived class. 
derived class can use all the functions which are defined in the base class, making the code reusable.
base class car
child classes:maruti car, tata car

Polymorphism: It is a feature, which lets us create functions with same name but different arguments, 
which will perform differently. That is function with same name, functioning in different way. 
Or, it also allows us to redefine a function to provide its new definition(run time poly).

Example:
In game when we give attack command all soldiers attack in their own way.Here method name is same but the behaviur is different
