What is MongoDB?
It is a DBMS of type NoSQL
It is a DBMS of type NoSQL->Document oriented

Document oriented NoSQL DBMS follow what concept?
Document oriented DBMS(MongoDB) works on the concept of collection and document like table and rows in RDBMS

What is collection?
collection is equivalent to RDBMS table.
collection is a group of documents
documents within a collection(like row in table) can have different fields.
Normally all documents in a collection are of similar or related purpose

What is document?
It is a set of key-value pair(like json object) like row in RDBMS

RDMBS Vs MongoDB?
Table --> Collection
Row --> Document
Column --> Fields
Joins --> No Joins(Embedded document)
PrimaryKey --> No need to make primary key(By default default key_id(unique) provided by mongoDb


How to run mongodb by command prompt?
go to drectory Bin(of mongodb) and run exe

Q)Advantages ?
    Schema less − MongoDB is a document database in which one collection holds different documents. Number of fields, 
    content and size of the document can differ from one document to another.
    Improved performance(No complex joins.)
    Deep query-ability. MongoDB supports dynamic queries on documents using a document-based query language
    that's nearly as powerful as SQL.   
    Ease of scale-out − MongoDB is easy to scale.
    Document Oriented Storage − Data is stored in the form of JSON style documents.

Where to Use MongoDB?
    Big Data
    Content Management and Delivery
    Mobile and Social Infrastructure
    User Data Management
    Data Hub
    
Steps to Configration:
Create a folder MongoDb in location C://Users/Suresh-Negi

Select the location to install C://Users/Suresh-Negi/MongoDB
Creare a folder in Data/Db in above location
Open first command prompt(server) and cnage directory to C://Users/Suresh-Negi/MongoDB/bin
run command mongod.exe --dbpath "C:\Users\suresh-negi\MongoDB\data'

Open other command prompt(client)
cnage directory to C://Users/Suresh-Negi/MongoDB/bin
run command mongod.exe(client strted)
again run command db.stats() it will give information about db.
If successfull means mongodb server is running and client can query to database
