SQL EXISTS Operator?
The EXISTS operator is used to test for the existence of any record in a subquery.
The EXISTS operator returns true if the subquery returns one or more records.

General Syntax:
    SELECT column-names
      FROM table-name
     WHERE EXISTS 
          (SELECT column-name
             FROM table-name
            WHERE condition)
            
Lists the suppliers with a product price less than 20:
SELECT SupplierName
FROM Suppliers
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT ProductName FROM Products WHERE SupplierId = Suppliers.supplierId AND Price < 20);

above query can be written using IN:
SELECT SupplierName
FROM Suppliers
WHERE SupplierId IN(SELECT SupplierId FROM Products WHERE  Price < 20)
