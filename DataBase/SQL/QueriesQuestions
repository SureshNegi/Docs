https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18932/how-can-i-remove-duplicate-rows

sol1)give each row rowid by partioning and then delete
with cte as(select row_number() over(id,name order by (select 0)) rn from tbl1)
delete from cte where rn>1;

sol2)if table has unique id field
 you GROUP BY the unique columns, and SELECT the MIN (or MAX) RowId as the row to keep. Then, just delete everything that didn't have a row id:
DELETE FROM MyTable
LEFT OUTER JOIN (
   SELECT MIN(RowId) as RowId, Col1, Col2, Col3 
   FROM MyTable 
   GROUP BY Col1, Col2, Col3
) as KeepRows ON
   MyTable.RowId = KeepRows.RowId
WHERE
   KeepRows.RowId IS NULL
