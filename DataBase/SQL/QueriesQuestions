https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18932/how-can-i-remove-duplicate-rows

sol1)give each row rowid by partioning and then delete
create table t1(id int)
insert into t1 values(1);
insert into t1 values(1);
insert into t1 values(1);
insert into t1 values(2);
insert into t1 values(2);
WITH CTE AS
(
SELECT *,ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY id ORDER BY id) AS RN
FROM t1
)
DELETE FROM CTE WHERE RN<>1
select * from t1;

sol2)if table has unique id field
 you GROUP BY the unique columns, and SELECT the MIN (or MAX) RowId as the row to keep. Then, just delete everything that didn't have a row id:
DELETE FROM MyTable
LEFT OUTER JOIN (
   SELECT MIN(RowId) as RowId, Col1, Col2, Col3 
   FROM MyTable 
   GROUP BY Col1, Col2, Col3
) as KeepRows ON
   MyTable.RowId = KeepRows.RowId
WHERE
   KeepRows.RowId IS NULL
