In SQL Server there are a couple a ways you can delete rows from a table. 
You can use the TRUNCATE and DELETE command.
The TRUNCATE command is like a DELETE command without the WHERE clause.
When you TRUNCATE a table less information is logged.  This means the TRUNCATE statement executes very fast; however,
it does so at the expense of not logging each row deleted.
This means, that you need to be very careful when using the command (actually be careful with DELETE as well!).

Here are some reasons to use TRUNCATE:
You want to “reset” a table to its empty state. All rows are removed, and identity key values reset to the initial defined values.
You need to have a super quick way of clearing out table data. I can see this occurring when you need to repeatedly import test data or you have routines that use work tables or 
scratch tables to store information.
You want to remove rows from a table without activating the table’s after delete trigger.
