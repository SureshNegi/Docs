SQL Server Functions?
SQL Server has many built-in functions.We can also create our new function
E.g:
SELECT AVG(Price) AS AveragePrice FROM Products; 
SELECT MAX(Price) AS LargestPrice FROM Products;

Return a specified part of a given date, as a string value:
SELECT DATENAME(yy, '2017/08/25') AS DatePartString; 
SELECT DATEPART(year, '2017/08/25') AS DatePartInt; 
SELECT GETDATE();
