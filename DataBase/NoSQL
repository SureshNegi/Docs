What is NoSQL?
It is Database management system like other DBMS RDBMS(SQL Server),OLAP(datawarehouses)

Why NoSQL?
History->
FlatFile System(No standared protocol)->RDBMS(Coddes rules, standardize)----->NoSQL(RDBMS slow performance due to-Joins,Constraints etc when data is huge(bigdata) like for 
facebook type application)

NoSQL Advantages?
Scalability
High Availability
Performance

NoSQL less functionality more performance means?
Because NoSQL does not support joins, constraints(these should be taken care of by the application layer) and other functionality as in RDBMS.
NoSQL performance is better then RDBMS. 

Why NoSQL is unstructured?
Like in RDBMS we have fix structured , we define table structured, column constrains etc.Therefore in RDBMS data is structured.
But in NoSQL data is not structured means we do'not define any structure.One entity structure may differ from other entity data structure
(like in facbook user data may very according to user choice).We can say NoSQL data is both structure and unstructure

Types of Database under NoSQL?
NoSQL database may be of following type(type:example):
Key Value Store:Redis
Tabular:BigTable,Hbase
Document Oriented:Example MongoDB
