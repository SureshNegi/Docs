Example:
Suppose a client needs a database design for his blog/website and see the differences between RDBMS and MongoDB schema design.
Website has the following requirements.
    Every post has the unique title, description and url.
    Every post can have one or more tags.
    Every post has the name of its publisher and total number of likes.
    Every post has comments given by users along with their name, message, data-time and likes.
    On each post, there can be zero or more comments.
    
RDBMS approch minimum 3 tables:
Table 1:Comments(comment_id,post_id,...)
Table 1:Post(id,title,des,url,likes,post_by)
Table 1:TagList(id,post_id,tag)

While in MongoDB schema, design will have one collection post and the following structure :
{
   _id: POST_ID
   title: TITLE_OF_POST, 
   description: POST_DESCRIPTION,
   by: POST_BY,
   url: URL_OF_POST,
   tags: [TAG1, TAG2, TAG3],
   likes: TOTAL_LIKES, 
   comments: [	
      {
         user:'COMMENT_BY',
         message: TEXT,
         dateCreated: DATE_TIME,
         like: LIKES 
      },
      {
         user:'COMMENT_BY',
         message: TEXT,
         dateCreated: DATE_TIME,
         like: LIKES
      }
   ]
}

So while showing the data, in RDBMS you need to join three tables and in MongoDB, data will be shown from one collection only.
