Before Angular:
Without a framework, you would be responsible for pushing data values into the HTML controls and turning user responses into actions and value updates. Writing such push/pull logic by hand is tedious, 
error-prone, and a nightmare to read as any experienced jQuery programmer can attest.

After angular:
Angular supports data binding, a mechanism for coordinating parts of a template with parts of a component. 
Add binding markup to the template HTML to tell Angular how to connect both sides.
Example:
<li>{{hero.name}}</li>
<app-hero-detail [hero]="selectedHero"></app-hero-detail>
<li (click)="selectHero(hero)"></li>

The {{hero.name}} interpolation displays the component's hero.name property value within the <li> element.
The [hero] property binding passes the value of selectedHero from the parent HeroListComponent to the hero property of the child HeroDetailComponent.
The (click) event binding calls the component's selectHero method when the user clicks a hero's name.

Two-way data binding :
<input [(ngModel)]="hero.name">

Data binding is also important for communication between parent and child components.
 partent template-->child component event--->parent component method
