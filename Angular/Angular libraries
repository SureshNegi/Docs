Angular ships as a collection of JavaScript modules. You can think of them as library modules.
Each Angular library name begins with the @angular prefix.
You install them with the npm package manager and import parts of them with JavaScript import statements.
For example, import Angular's Component decorator from the @angular/core library like this:
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
