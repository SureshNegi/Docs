Templates:
https://angular.io/guide/architecture
You define a component's view with its companion template. A template is a form of HTML that tells Angular how to render the component.
A template looks like regular HTML, except for a few differences. Here is a template for our HeroListComponent:

<h2>Hero List</h2>
<p><i>Pick a hero from the list</i></p>
<ul>
  <li *ngFor="let hero of heroes" (click)="selectHero(hero)">
    {{hero.name}}
  </li>
</ul>
<app-hero-detail *ngIf="selectedHero" [hero]="selectedHero"></app-hero-detail>
