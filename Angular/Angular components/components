Components are the fundamental building blocks of Angular applications. 
They display data on the screen, listen for user input, and take action based on that input.
Creating component:
e.g componentDemo.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core'; //injecting/including Component
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',   //tag for html
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',  
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'] 
})
//model(like scope)  having data for page
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'Tour of Heroes';
}
Break Components(single reponibility principle):
Keeping all features in one component as the application grows will not be maintainable.
You'll want to split up large components into smaller sub-components, each focused on a specific task or workflow.
