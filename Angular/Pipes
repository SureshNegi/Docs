Built-in pipes
Angular comes with a stock of pipes such as DatePipe, UpperCasePipe, LowerCasePipe, CurrencyPipe, and PercentPipe. 
They are all available for use in any template.

Parameterizing a pipe:
To add parameters to a pipe, follow the pipe name with a colon ( : ) and then the parameter value (such as currency:'EUR'). 
<p>The hero's birthday is {{ birthday | date:"MM/dd/yy" }} </p>
 <span class="spanWeekOf">
 {{dayDate | date:"EEEE dd<br/>MMM, yyyy"}}
 </span>
 
 Chaining pipes
 The chained hero's birthday is
{{  birthday | date:'fullDate' | uppercase}}
