 A directive is a class with a @Directive decorator. 
 A component is technically a directive
 Angular defines the @Component decorator, which extends the @Directive decorator with template-oriented features
 
 Types of directives :
 There are 2 kinds of directives besides components: structural and attribute directives. 
 
 Structural directives:
 alter layout by adding, removing, and replacing elements in DOM
 Example:
*ngFor is an iterative; it tells Angular to stamp out one <li> per hero in the heroes list.
*ngIf is a conditional; it includes the HeroDetail component only if a selected hero exists.

Attribute directives:
Attribute directives alter the appearance or behavior of an existing element.

Example:
The ngModel directive:implements two-way data binding
Example:
<input [(ngModel)]="hero.name">
