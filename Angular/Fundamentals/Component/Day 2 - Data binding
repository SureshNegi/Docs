Without a framework(like angular), we are responsible for pushing data values into the HTML controls and turning user responses into actions and value updates. 
Writing such push/pull logic by hand is tedious(like in jquery).

Angular two-way data binding:
Example:<input [(ngModel)]="hero.name">

Binding Event: (eventName)="methodName()"
Binding Property:[width]="widthValue"
Show Value: {{value}}

Data binding plays an important role in communication between a template and its component,
and is also important for communication between parent and child components.
