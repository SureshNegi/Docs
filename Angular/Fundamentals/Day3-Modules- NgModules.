Angular apps are modular and Angular has its own modularity system called NgModules.
NgModule :
is a container for a cohesive block of code dedicated to an application domain, a workflow, or a closely related set of capabilities.
It can contain components, service providers, and other code files whose scope is defined by the containing NgModule
It can import functionality that is exported from other NgModules
export selected functionality for use by other NgModules.
Every Angular app has at least one NgModule class, the root module, which is conventionally named AppModule and resides in 
a file named app.module.ts.
While a small application might have only one NgModule, most apps have many more feature modules.
