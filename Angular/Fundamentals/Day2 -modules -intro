Every Angular app has a root module, conventionally named AppModule which provides the bootstrap mechanism that launches the application
An app typically contains many functional modules.

NgModules can import functionality from other NgModules, and allow their own functionality to be exported and used by other NgModules.
E.g We can use AppRoutingModule in our main AppModule to use routing.

import { RouterModule, Routes,PreloadAllModules } from '@angular/router';
@NgModule({  
  imports: [ 
    //RouterModule.forRoot(routes) ,
    RouterModule.forRoot(routes, { useHash: true, preloadingStrategy: PreloadAllModules }),
  ],
  exports: [ RouterModule ]
})
export class AppRoutingModule {}

Why Different Modules(like namespace in .Net)
Organizing your code into distinct functional modules helps in:
-managing development of complex applications.
-in designing for reusability
-take advantage of lazy-loading(that is, loading modules on demandâ€”in order to minimize the amount of code that needs to be loaded at startup.)
