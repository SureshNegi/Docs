The URL could arrive directly from the browser address bar. But most of the time you navigate as a result of some user action such as the click of an anchor tag.
Example:
template: `
  <h1>Angular Router</h1>
  <nav>
    <a routerLink="/crisis-center" routerLinkActive="active">Crisis Center</a>
    <a routerLink="/heroes" routerLinkActive="active">Heroes</a>
  </nav>
  <router-outlet></router-outlet>
`

The RouterLink directives on the anchor tags give the router control over those elements. The navigation paths are fixed, so you can assign a
string to the routerLink (a "one-time" binding).
