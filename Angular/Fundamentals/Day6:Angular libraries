Angular ships as a collection of JavaScript modules. You can think of them as library modules. Each Angular library name begins with the @angular prefix. Install them with the npm package manager
and import parts of them with JavaScript import statements.

For example, import Angular's Component decorator from the @angular/core library like this:
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

You also import NgModules from Angular libraries using JavaScript import statements:
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';

In this way you're using both the Angular and JavaScript module systems together.
(as @angular/core etc are javascript libraires - contains.js files)
