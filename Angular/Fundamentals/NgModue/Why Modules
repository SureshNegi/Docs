NgModules consolidate components, directives, and pipes into cohesive blocks of functionality, each focused on a feature area, 
application business domain, workflow,or common collection of utilities.

Modules can be loaded eagerly when the application starts or lazy loaded asynchronously by the router.

The root module is all you need in a simple application with a few components.
As the app grows, you refactor the root module into feature modules that represent collections of related functionality. 
You then import these modules into the root module.
