Feature modules are NgModules for the purpose of organizing code.

As your app grows, you can organize code relevant for a specific feature(or module).
This helps apply clear boundaries for features(seprate ).
 With feature modules, you can keep code related to a specific functionality or feature separate from other code.
 Delineating areas of your app helps with collaboration between developers and teams, separating directives, 
 and managing the size of the root module.
 
 Feature modules vs. root modules
A feature module delivers a cohesive set of functionality focused on a specific application 
such as a user workflow, routing, or forms.
While you can do everything within the root module, feature modules help you partition the app into focused areas
 A feature module collaborates with the root module and with other modules through the services it provides and the
components, directives, and pipes that it shares.
