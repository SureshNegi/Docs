An entry component is any component that Angular loads imperatively, (which means youâ€™re not referencing it in the template).
There are two main kinds of entry components:
The bootstrapped root component.
A component you specify in a route definition.

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    FormsModule,
    HttpModule,
    AppRoutingModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent] // bootstrapped entry component
})
A bootstrapped component is an entry component that Angular loads into the DOM during the bootstrap process (application launch).

The second kind of entry component occurs in a route definition like this:
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    component: CustomerListComponent
  }
];

All router components must be entry components.
Because this would require you to add the component in two places (router and entryComponents) the Compiler is smart enough to 
recognize that this is a router definition and automatically add the router component into entryComponents.
