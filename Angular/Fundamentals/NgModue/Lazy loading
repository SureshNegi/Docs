 Lazy loading:
This behavior necessarily changes when you use lazy loading. Lazy loading is when you load modules only when you need them; for example, 
when routing. They aren’t loaded right away like with eagerly loaded modules. This means that any services listed in their provider arrays
aren’t available because the root injector doesn’t 
know about these modules.
