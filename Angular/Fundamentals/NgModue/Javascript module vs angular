In JavaScript, modules are individual files with JavaScript code in them. To make what’s in them available, you write an export statement, 
usually after the relevant code, like this:
export class AppComponent { ... }
Then, when you need that file’s code in another file, you import it like this:
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

NgModules
NgModules are classes decorated with @NgModule. The @NgModule decorator’s imports array tells Angular what other NgModules the current module needs. The modules in the imports array are different than JavaScript modules because they are NgModules rather than regular JavaScript modules. Classes with an @NgModule decorator are by convention kept in their own files, but what makes them an NgModule isn’t being in their own file, like JavaScript modules; 
it’s the presence of @NgModule and its metadata.
