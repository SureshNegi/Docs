The structure of an NgModule is the same whether it is a root module or a feature module. 

step 1: ng generate module CustomerDashboard
This will create a folder called customer-dashboard with a file inside called customer-dashboard.module.ts with the following contents:
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
@NgModule({
  imports: [
    CommonModule
  ],
  declarations: []
})
export class CustomerDashboardModule { }

In the CLI generated feature module, there are two JavaScript import statements at the top of the file: the first imports NgModule, 
which, like the root module, lets you use the @NgModule decorator; the second imports CommonModule, 
which contributes many common directives such as ngIf and ngFor. 
Feature modules import CommonModule instead of BrowserModule, which is only imported once in the root module
CommonModule only contains information for common directives such as ngIf and ngFor which are needed in most templates, whereas BrowserModule configures the 
Angular app for the browser which needs to be done only once.

Step 2:Create the components for the module
ng generate component customer-dashboard/CustomerDashboard
This generates a folder for the new component within the customer-dashboard folder and updates the feature module 
with the CustomerDashboardComponent info:
// import the new component
import { CustomerDashboardComponent } from './customer-dashboard/customer-dashboard.component';
@NgModule({
  imports: [
    CommonModule
  ],
  declarations: [
    CustomerDashboardComponent
  ],
})

Step 3:to use components in root module mention it in export
exports: [
  CustomerDashboardComponent
]

Step 4:Import feature module in root module
import { CustomerDashboardModule } from './customer-dashboard/customer-dashboard.module';
  imports: [
    ...
    CustomerDashboardModule // add the feature module here
  ],

Step 5:update appcomponent.html:
<h1>
  {{title}}
</h1>
<!-- add the selector from the CustomerDashboardComponent -->
<app-customer-dashboard></app-customer-dashboard>
