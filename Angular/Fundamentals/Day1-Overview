Angular is a platform and framework for building client applications in HTML and TypeScript.
Angular is itself written in TypeScript.

Modules(NgModules):
The basic building blocks of an Angular application are NgModulesan.Angular app is defined by a set of NgModules. 
An app always has at least a root module that enables bootstrapping, and typically has many more feature modules.
E.g:
app.module.ts:
@NgModule({
declarations:[register components here],
  imports: [featuer modules],
  providers: [services],
  bootstrap:[bootstrapComponent]
  
 Components :
 Every app has at least a root component.
 
 services:
 Components use services, which provide specific functionality not directly related to views. Service providers can be injected into components as dependencies, making your code modular, 
 reusable, and efficient.
 
 Create Components/services:
 Both components and services are simply classes, with decorators that mark their type and provide metadata that tells Angular 
 how to use them.
 E.g:
 The metadata for a component class associates it with a template that defines a view. 
 @Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
  title = 'app works!';  
  constructor() {}
  ngOnInit(){}
}

The metadata for a service class provides the information Angular needs to make it available
to components through Dependency Injection (DI).
@Injectable()
export class actionPlanService {}
