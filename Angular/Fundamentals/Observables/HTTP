Angular’s HttpClient returns observables from HTTP method calls. For instance, http.get(‘/api’) returns an observable. 
This provides several advantages over promise-based HTTP APIs:
HTTP requests are cancellable through the unsubscribe() method
Requests can be configured to get progress event updates.
Failed requests can be retried easily.
