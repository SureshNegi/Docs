A component should not need to define things like :
1)how to fetch data from the server
2)validate user input
3)log directly to the console etc

Instead, it can delegate such tasks to services. 
By defining above kind of processing task in class(an injectable service class), we make it available to any component.

Is service must?
Angular doesn't enforce these principles.
Angular does help you follow these principles by making it easy to factor our application logic into services and 
make those services available to components through dependency injection.

Example:
export class Logger {
  log(msg: any)   { console.log(msg); }
  error(msg: any) { console.error(msg); }
  warn(msg: any)  { console.warn(msg); }
}
