JavaScript (ES2015) module system :for managing collections of JavaScript objects.
The NgModule system is different from and unrelated to the JavaScript (ES2015) module.
These are two different and complementary module systems. You can use them both to write your apps.

Javascript Module Example:
Actionplan.controller.js(Node js service controller)
var service = require('../service/actionplan.service');
var ActionPlanController = {
    getActionPlanForMeasure: function (req, res, connection, callback) {       
        let postData = req.body;              
        service.getActionPlanForMeasure(connection, postData, res)
    },
    getActionPlanByAssessment: function (req, res, connection, callback) {       
        let postData = req.body; 
        let obj={teamId:req.query.teamId,assessmentId:req.query.assId,month:req.query.month} 
        console.log(obj);           
        service.getActionPlanByAssessment(connection, obj, res)
    }
    
};
module.exports = ActionPlanController;

In JavaScript each file is a module and all objects defined in the file belong to that module.
The module declares some objects to be public by marking them with the export key word. 
Other JavaScript modules use import statements to access public objects from other modules.
