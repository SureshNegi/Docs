Angular needs to know how the pieces of your application fit together and what other files 
and libraries the app requires. This information is called metadata

Like;
Here we are providing the metadata to angular about our component and we not need to take care about the internal mechanim
@Component({
  selector: 'app-heroes',
  templateUrl: './heroes.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./heroes.component.css']
})
