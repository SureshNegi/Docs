 Every application has at least one Angular Module, the root module that you bootstrap to launch the application. You can call the class anything you want. 
 The conventional name is AppModule.
 
  @NgModule decorator.
  @NgModule takes a metadata object that tells Angular how to compile and launch the application.
  @NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})

The declarations array:
You tell Angular which components belong to the AppModule by listing it in the module's declarations array. 
other kinds of classes — directives and pipes — that you must also add to the declarations array.
Only declarables — components, directives and pipes — belong in the declarations array. Do not put any other kind of class in declarations. 
Do not declare NgModule classes. Do not declare service classes. Do not declare model classes.

The imports array:
Angular Modules are a way to consolidate features that belong together into discrete units.
Many features of Angular itself are organized as Angular Modules. 
HTTP services are in the HttpClientModule. The router is in the RouterModule.
Eventually you may create your own modules.
Add a module to the imports array when the application requires its features.
 Every application that executes in a browser needs the BrowserModule from @angular/platform-browser. 
 So every such application includes the BrowserModule in its root AppModule's imports array. 
 @NgModule metadata object mports array- It tells Angular about
 specific other Angular Modules—all of them classes decorated with @NgModule—that the application needs to function properly.
